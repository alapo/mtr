# mtr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

mtr stands for "Misc Tools for R" which is my collection of functions that I have either made or gathered throughout my data science projects. Most are nothing special, but they solve unique problems I could not find in other packages (or are slightly tweaked).

## Installation

To install these functions use the pacman lines 

``` r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("alapo/mtr")
```

or you can use the devtools lines below.

``` r
devtools::install_github("alapo/mtr")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mtr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
